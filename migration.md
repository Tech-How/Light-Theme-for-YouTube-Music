# Migration to Stylus

In the coming months, this style, and my others, will be making the shift to Userstyles.world, an open development platform for userstyles.

### What does this mean?
Instead of downloading my styles from Userstyles.org for the Stylish extension, you will download them from this GitHub page or userstyles.world, and use the Stylus extension.

### Why are you making this change?
Stylish doesn't support several features that I would like to use, and new bugs are being introduced with their extension that break my styles. I also strive for ease-of-use, and this will allow me to provide a one-click install method, and provide automatic updates, ensuring your copy remains up-to-date and bug free.

### What actions should I take?
Right now, you don't have to do anything. When I start the transition, the version hosted on Userstyles.org for the Stylish extension will **no longer be updated.** To receive future updates, you must uninstall the style from Stylish, and re-install it for the Stylus extension using the button on the readme.
