A refreshing new look for YouTube Music.

A simple, minimalist style for the YouTube Music web client that enables light mode and other small enhancements. It's important for the web to be accessible to everyone, and not having the option for a light color palette hinders the experience for some users. Or maybe you simply prefer a light theme. Either way, this style aims to give YouTube Music an updated look and feel that's more consistent with the modern web. I'm always looking to improve, so if you notice an issue or have a suggestion, feel free to send it my way. Hope you like it!

âš  I am aware of many recent overhauls/UI changes to YouTube Music. Google is currently [A/B testing](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/) a lot of new changes/features at the moment, and it's really hard for me to keep up. I had the sidebar for a little while, and then they took it away. They are also redesigning various elements of the web player that only some people have, and each person has a slightly different variation of that UI experiment. As Google works to consolidate its mobile and desktop user base, they will be significantly ramping up production of the web player to keep up to speed with other major music streaming platforms. These A/B tests go on for months at a time, sometimes even close to a year. I'm doing my best with the limited time that I have to create a polished and accessible theme for YouTube Music. I appreciate your patience and support in the meantime.
