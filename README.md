Making YouTube Music beautiful, and accessible.

Finally, a thorough light theme for YouTube Music. Some people prefer the dark theme, but for most people, black text on a white background is easier to read. I've gone above and beyond simply changing the background to solid white and the text to solid black. I've tried different shades, faded the colors out a little, and constructed a public release of this project. I've gone through every menu, including the Settings page, Upgrade tab, fullscreen player, album page, playlist editing, scroll bars, and much more. And with a bit of inspiration from Apple's design choices, added rounded corners and shadowing to elements like album artwork to make them pop. Heck, I've even fixed three of Google's bugs/bad margin choices in the process! After weeks of work and thinking, I'm proud to present this theme that I hope you will enjoy and that I hope to maintain.

⚠ YouTube is currently rolling out a new button shape for various elements, and it has been known to break this style. It's not fully rolled out to me yet, but when it does, I will start working on a fix. This will take a while, as my time is finite and restyling every button on the webpage can take quite a while. I appreciate your patience and understanding!

Update: I am currently patching the style as of March 7th, 2023. Expect an update soon!

⚠ In the coming months, my styles will be migrating to the Stylus extension and will be hosted on userstyles.world. [Learn more](https://github.com/Tech-How/Light-Theme-for-YouTube-Music/blob/main/migration.md) about what this change means for you, and what steps you should take.
