# Light Theme for YouTube Music
A refreshing new look for YouTube Music.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tech-How/Light-Theme-for-YouTube-Music/main/images/repo/readme/4.png"/>

A simple, minimalist style for the YouTube Music web client that enables light mode and other small enhancements. It's important for the web to be accessible to everyone, and not having the option for a light color palette hinders the experience for some users. Or maybe you simply prefer a light theme. Either way, this style aims to give YouTube Music an updated look and feel that's more consistent with the modern web. I'm always looking to improve, so if you notice an issue or have a suggestion, feel free to send it my way. Hope you like it!

âš  I am aware of the recent major UI overhaul done to YouTube Music, introducing a new Spotify-like sidebar and tweaking the search bar. I will eventually get around to updating this style, as it's just a hobby project and I'm working on other things at the moment. I always strive to produce the most polished, best quality work I can, so I'll never release a product before I beleive its fully ready. I appreciate your support and patience!
