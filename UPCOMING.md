# Upcoming Changes

# Planned Projects (No Guarantee)

- Redesign music lists, like playlists and the queue.
- Add animations to elements like the opening and closing of menus.
- Redesign immersive header/Artist pages. (Excited for this one!)
- Make the background of the 'Now Playing' page blur to the album color, like Pandora.
