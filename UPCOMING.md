# Upcoming Changes
- Style Google's new feature: Seamless switching between Song and Video on the player page. (Waiting for the team to fix a few bugs)
(Update 5/7/22: Bug report submitted to Google, will wait for a possible fix before hiding the element with the display property.)

# Planned Projects (No Guarantee)

- Redesign music lists, like playlists and the queue.
- Add animations to elements like the opening and closing of menus.
- Redesign immersive header/Artist pages.
- Make the background of the 'Now Playing' page blur to the album color, like Pandora.
