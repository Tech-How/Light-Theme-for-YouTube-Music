# Upcoming Changes

- Attempt to fix a very specific issue for my users with the [Dark Reader Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh). Make all box shadow elements not show a white glow, but rather a dark one. (Edit: The fix has been implemented and will be shipped with the next update! I think it looks really nice, here's a glimpse with a [song](https://i.ibb.co/m8Tw9f7/song.png) and a [video.](https://i.ibb.co/NrZVydf/video.png))

# Planned Projects (No Guarantee)

- Redesign music lists, like playlists and the queue.
- Add animations to elements like the opening and closing of menus.
- Redesign immersive header/Artist pages. (Excited for this one!)
- Make the background of the 'Now Playing' page blur to the album color, like Pandora.
