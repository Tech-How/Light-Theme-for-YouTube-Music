# Upcoming Changes

- Attempt to fix a very specific issue for my users with the [Dark Reader Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh). Make all box shadow elements not show a white glow, but rather a dark one.

# Planned Projects (No Guarantee)

- Redesign music lists, like playlists and the queue.
- Add animations to elements like the opening and closing of menus.
- Redesign immersive header/Artist pages. (Excited for this one!)
