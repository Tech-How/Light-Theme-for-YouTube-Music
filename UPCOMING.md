# Upcoming Changes
- Fix black text on pop-ups when you add a song to a playlist, like a song, dislike, etc. I plan to make them white for consistency with other pop-ups.

# Planned Projects (No Guarantee)

- Redesign music lists, like playlists and the queue.
- Add animations to elements like the opening and closing of menus.
- Redesign immersive header/Artist pages.
- Make the background of the 'Now Playing' page blur to the album color, like Pandora premium.
